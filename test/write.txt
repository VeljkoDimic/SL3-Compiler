Write prints out all of the s-expressions. It returns the value of the last executed s-expression. Currently only supports unsigned 32 bit integers, so for example -1 will return 4294967295 (which is equivalent to signed -1). For recursive write calls, the inner s-expressions are evaluated first, so the example program will write 12 first, then write in the order of the values in the outer write. This can be further nested.

Expected output:
12
5
10
4294967295
10
12

Return value:
12
